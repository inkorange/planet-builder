# Description of Project:

The idea of the application is to create your own world that will run through a simulator over billions of years to see what type of planet it becomes.

Planets have formed in the universe through the aggregation of different minerals, cosmic collisions, and by chance to develop life and ecosystems. Setting the seeds billions of years in the past, over billions of years we see a planet evolve. Based on what ingredients we feed into the planet, we will see different outcomes.

The goal of the application is gamifying the creation of worlds. It can be interacted with purely to see what would happen if I throw a bunch of elements into it, or there can be goals to aim for, how to seed a planet with what minerals and distance from a star, what type of star too, to create life, or to create an ice world with a warm sea underneath.

# Educational Purposes:

We can loosely educate the user on what happens when certain elements are mixed in a planet, and see where it goes, give examples of planets we know of today, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Earth.

# Research:

We need to understand how certain planets have evolved to be the geology and biology of how they are today. The game needs to be mostly based on real scientific facts. There are examples in the adjacent markdown files:

# Elements to consider to add to the recipe of the planet:

### **1\. Hydrogen (H)**

The most abundant element in the universe. It forms the basis of gas giants (Jupiter, Saturn) and key compounds like water and organic molecules. In stars and nebulae, hydrogen dictates early planet formation.

---

### **2\. Helium (He)**

A product of stellar fusion and a major component of gas giants. Though chemically inert, helium’s presence influences a planet’s mass, density, and internal heat retention, particularly in gas giants.

---

### **3\. Oxygen (O)**

The third most abundant element in the cosmos and essential for rocky planets and life. It forms oxides and silicates in crusts, and water (H₂O) — the defining molecule for habitability and atmospheric chemistry.

---

### **4\. Carbon (C)**

The backbone of organic chemistry and atmospheric evolution. Carbon forms CO₂, methane, and carbonates that regulate planetary temperature and the greenhouse effect, shaping climates and biospheres.

---

### **5\. Silicon (Si)**

A cornerstone of planetary crusts and mantles. Silicate minerals (SiO₂, MgSiO₃) dominate rocky planets like Earth, Venus, and Mars. Silicates determine tectonic behavior, crust strength, and magma chemistry.

---

### **6\. Iron (Fe)**

The defining element of planetary cores. Iron’s density drives differentiation (core vs. mantle) and generates magnetic fields through convection in molten form — vital for atmospheric protection and long-term stability.

---

### **7\. Magnesium (Mg)**

Common in mantles and crusts, forming minerals like olivine and pyroxene. Magnesium influences mantle viscosity and volcanic activity, shaping surface renewal and tectonic motion.

---

### **8\. Sulfur (S)**

Chemically reactive and important in both geology and biology. Sulfur compounds contribute to volcanic emissions, mineralization, and biological metabolism. It also affects planetary coloration and atmosphere (e.g., Venus’s clouds).

---

### **9\. Nitrogen (N)**

A key atmospheric regulator. On Earth and Titan, nitrogen forms dense atmospheres and supports organic chemistry. It acts as an inert background gas moderating pressure and temperature balance.

---

### **10\. Aluminum (Al)**

A refractory element that helps define crustal composition. It contributes to mineral stability and continental crust formation through aluminosilicate minerals like feldspar.

---

### **11\. Calcium (Ca)**

Important in rock formation (as calcium silicates and carbonates). It participates in crustal recycling and regulates carbon storage in oceans and sediments on habitable worlds.

---

### **12\. Sodium (Na)**

Common in crustal minerals and planetary oceans. It influences fluid chemistry, salt cycles, and the conductivity of magma and subsurface brines.

---

### **13\. Potassium (K)**

A key radioactive heat source (through K-40 decay). Along with uranium and thorium, potassium drives internal heat, enabling mantle convection, volcanism, and tectonics for billions of years.

---

### **14\. Phosphorus (P)**

A critical element for life, forming DNA, ATP, and cell membranes. In geology, it occurs in apatite minerals. Its availability controls biological productivity and biochemical potential.

---

### **15\. Nickel (Ni)**

Often paired with iron in planetary cores, nickel contributes to magnetism and density structure. It plays a role in both core solidification and surface mineral chemistry.

---

### **How They Shape Planets**

These fifteen elements work together through **three planetary systems**:

* **Geological framework:** Iron, silicon, magnesium, aluminum, calcium, and oxygen build crusts, mantles, and cores.

* **Atmospheric and chemical balance:** Hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen govern climate, oxidation state, and habitability.

* **Biological potential and energy:** Carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur — the CHNOPS group — form life’s chemistry.

* **Thermal evolution:** Radioactive potassium, uranium, and thorium (honorable mentions) power internal heat that drives geology and magnetic fields.

---

### **In Short**

Planetary evolution is chemistry on a cosmic scale. From gas giants to rocky worlds, it’s these 15 elements — forged in dying stars — that define whether a planet becomes a barren rock, a volcanic inferno, an icy sphere, or a living world like Earth.

# Environmental Consideration for Planetary Evolution:

### **1\. Distance from the Star (Orbital Zone)**

The most fundamental factor. How close or far a planet forms determines temperature, phase of matter, and chemistry.

* **Close to the star:** Metals and silicates survive, forming rocky planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars).

* **Beyond the frost line:** Water, methane, and ammonia condense, creating icy bodies and gas giants (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune).

* **Too far out:** Energy scarcity limits atmosphere and geologic activity.

---

### **2\. Type of Star**

A planet’s evolution depends heavily on the **spectral type and stability** of its star.

* **Hot stars (O, B, A types):** Short-lived and violent, blasting planets with UV radiation.

* **Sun-like stars (G types):** Long-lived and stable — ideal for habitability.

* **Cool red dwarfs (M types):** Common but prone to stellar flares that can strip atmospheres, though tidally locked planets may still survive in habitable zones (e.g., TRAPPIST-1 system).

---

### **3\. Planetary Mass and Gravity**

Mass determines everything: whether a planet can hold an atmosphere, sustain magnetic fields, or maintain internal heat.

* **Low-mass planets** (like Mars) cool quickly, lose air, and become geologically inactive.

* **High-mass planets** (like Earth or super-Earths) maintain tectonics and atmospheres longer.

* **Gas giants** have enough gravity to retain hydrogen and helium, forming thick envelopes.

---

### **4\. Rotation Speed**

Rotation shapes climate, atmospheric dynamics, and magnetic field generation.

* **Fast rotators** (Earth, Jupiter) have strong Coriolis effects, driving jet streams and storms.

* **Slow rotators** (Venus) experience extreme temperature contrasts and weak magnetic protection.

---

### **5\. Magnetic Field Strength**

Generated by a rotating, convecting metallic core, a magnetic field shields a planet from solar wind and radiation.

* **Earth:** Strong field prevents atmosphere loss.

* **Mars:** Lost its dynamo early, leading to atmospheric erosion.

* **Mercury:** Has a weak but active magnetic field, suggesting a partially molten core.

---

### **6\. Axial Tilt (Obliquity)**

Tilt controls the **seasons** and energy distribution across the planet.

* **Earth’s 23.5° tilt** creates moderate, life-friendly seasons.

* **Uranus’s 98° tilt** produces extreme seasonal swings.

* **Zero-tilt planets** (like Mercury) have near-constant day/night hemispheres.

---

### **7\. Orbital Eccentricity**

How circular or elliptical the orbit is affects climate stability.

* **Low eccentricity:** Predictable climate cycles (Earth).

* **High eccentricity:** Periodic freeze-thaw extremes (e.g., Mars and some exoplanets).

---

### **8\. Composition of the Protoplanetary Disk**

The chemical makeup of the disk determines what kinds of planets can form.

* **Inner disk:** Metal and silicate-rich.

* **Outer disk:** Ice and gas-rich.  
   Variations in dust-to-gas ratio or metallicity shape whether a system favors rocky or gaseous planets.

---

### **9\. Presence of Gas Giants**

Gas giants act as gravitational architects, influencing smaller worlds.

* **Jupiter** protected the inner Solar System from excessive comet bombardment but also disrupted asteroid formation.

* Systems without gas giants may produce more super-Earths or mini-Neptunes.

---

### **10\. Tidal Forces**

Gravitational pull from a nearby planet or star causes internal heating and orbital evolution.

* **Io (Jupiter’s moon):** Constant tidal flexing fuels volcanic activity.

* **Europa and Enceladus:** Tidal heat sustains subsurface oceans.

* **Tidal locking** can freeze one hemisphere while roasting the other.

---

### **11\. Atmospheric Retention and Escape**

A planet’s gravity, temperature, and magnetic field dictate whether it keeps its atmosphere.

* **High escape velocity \+ cool temperature \= strong retention** (Earth, Venus).

* **Low gravity \+ solar wind \= atmospheric loss** (Mars, Mercury).

* **Hydrogen-rich gas giants** hold even the lightest molecules.

---

### **12\. Internal Heat and Radioactive Decay**

Internal energy drives volcanism, plate tectonics, and magnetic fields.

* Generated from three main sources:

  1. **Accretional heat** (leftover from formation)

  2. **Differentiation energy** (core formation)

  3. **Radioactive decay** (Uranium, Thorium, Potassium)  
      Planets with strong internal heat (Earth, Io) remain geologically active; cold bodies (the Moon) go dormant.

---

### **13\. Planetary Collisions and Late Bombardment**

Impacts reshape planets dramatically.

* **Earth’s Moon** likely formed from a massive impact with Theia.

* **Mercury** may have lost much of its crust in a colossal collision.

* Bombardment periods deliver water, metals, and organic material — or strip them away.

---

### **14\. Presence of Moons**

Moons stabilize rotation, influence tides, and affect magnetic and climate stability.

* **Earth’s Moon** keeps our axial tilt stable.

* **Tidal effects** drive ocean mixing and even early biological rhythms.

* **No moons (like Venus)** may lead to unstable long-term tilts.

---

### **15\. Stellar and Galactic Environment**

Planets evolve not just under their own star but within their **galactic neighborhood**.

* Nearby supernovae can irradiate or strip atmospheres.

* Dense stellar clusters increase collision likelihood.

* Galactic metallicity influences available elements for planet formation.

---

### **Putting It All Together**

Planetary evolution isn’t just chemistry — it’s a balance of **distance, energy, motion, and protection**.

* **Too close to the star:** Lava worlds and scorched atmospheres.

* **Too far:** Ice and silence.

* **Just right:** Oceans, weather, and geology — the ingredients of habitability.

Each planet’s story is the result of these interacting factors — gravity sculpting heat, motion shaping air, and starlight defining everything else.
